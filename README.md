# Workday-Scheduler

## Description

My motivation for this project was to help users organize their daily tasks into a Work Day Scheduler with the
code I wrote in JavaScript and updated in HTML. I built this project in order to finish an incomplete scheduling webpage that would give the user a sense of control over their busy schedule through organization with past, present, and future color-coded time-blocks. This project solves the problem of unordered chaos in one's day and leaves the user's mind a bit more relieved in having their schedule logged into a scheduler that also saves the input even after the webpage is refreshed. I learned how to add and remove classes in JavaScript in order to control the color-coding of the time-blocks. I also learned how to use Dayjs to create a current hour within the scheduler and how to save input into the local storage. This past week's class in Bootcamp taught me many things like mentioned before in order to succeed in this project.


## Usage

To use this Work Day Scheduler, start by clicking on the time-block of the hour you want to add a task onto. Type the task and click the save button on the right side to save it. When you refresh the webpage, the input will still be logged into the time-block. You can also open up Devtools on the webpage by right-clicking the screen and open the applications tabs to see your input in the local storage. On this scheduler, you will also notice gray, red, and green backgrounds on your time-blocks. The gray is for the past hours, red is for the present hour, and green is for the future hours. The datestamp at the top of the screen will alo change to the current date as you continue to use it.
